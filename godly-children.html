            Are you concerned over the permissiveness of sin, the unruliness of
            the world we live in today and the influence it could likely have on
            your children? <br> <br> Is teaching them moral education strong enough to provide the internal control they need to say no to the things they should disapprove of?<br><br> The Psalmist said , thy
            word have I hidden in my heart so that I might not sin against you.
            Psalm 119:11. The antidote to worldliness is the power of God's word
            hidden in the hearts of our children. <br> <br>God instructed in Deuteronomy
            6: 6 - 9 what we should do as parents

          <p> 6 And these words, which I
            command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: 7 And thou shalt
            teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when
            thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and
            when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. 8 And thou shalt bind
            them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets
            between thine eyes. 9 And thou shalt write them upon the posts of
            thy house, and on thy gates. <br><br>From the above scripture, we are to diligently teach our children God’s word by all means possible; when we sit at home, walk by the way, lie down, rise up, bind them as a sign on their hand, as frontlets between our eyes, write them upon the posts of our houses and on our gates.

            My testimony is that of a parent who is intentional about displaying content & inscriptions about God all around my children so that they eat, breathe and sleep in God’s magnificent word.

            I do this by pasting scriptures on their walls, placing scripture cards in their cots while they sleep and now that they are of school age, I give them the cards to take to school. My husband also bought them complete bibles that they are happy to take to school and to church.

            This is similar to the principle Jacob used on animals (that have no spirit) yet they were able to conceive what they saw, how much more are our children who have a spirit and a soul beholding God’s word that is quick and powerful. The result of that contact has been life-transforming for my children. <br> <br> With all glory to God, I can say my children are exceptional and God-conscious. Their desires, conversations and playtime are always biblically inclined and it amazes me

            My 7year old daughter was asked to create a story on slides for her ICT project and when I read her story it was that of Abraham and Sarah; though she gave the characters different names.

            I see this juxtaposition play out a lot. My second daughter at 4years old was walking into the bathroom one night, it was dark and she was obviously scared. From the sitting room, I heard her say repeatedly, "I do not have the spirit of fear but of power, love and a sound mind" while she carefully went into the bathroom.

My young son believes in rebuking anything that comes in his way, even flies. His childlike faith in God is incredible.

            At the time I started having children, getting beautifully made scripture cards was thin on the ground, so I had to hand make them. <br> But not anymore, thanks to <a href="./index.html">Lit Lambs</a>.
